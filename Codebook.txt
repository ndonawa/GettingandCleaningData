CodeBook

The purpose of this code book is to describe:
  1: Variables
  2: Data
  3: Updates
  
Datasources include:
  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 
  https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
  


The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

These variables were estimated from the following set of signals:
  mean
  std
  
Additional vectors created through subset of data
  Metrics subsset of:
    activity ID
    subject ID
    
Final Data set output of merging:
  metrics, training results, and test results.
